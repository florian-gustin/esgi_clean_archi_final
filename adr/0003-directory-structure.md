# 3. Directory Structure

Date: 2023-02-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we decided to go with the DDD hexagonal, we must define the directory structure.

## Decision

We will use the following directory structure:

- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure

## Consequences

There is no Presentation layer because we will use a CLI. We have difficulties to use this layer for the CLI.

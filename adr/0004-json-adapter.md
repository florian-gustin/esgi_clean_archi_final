# 4. Json Adapter

Date: 2023-02-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There were 2 implementations of the Json Adapter made by the team. We have to choose one of them.

## Decision

We have decided to use the gson implementation because it is more simple and it is more readable.

## Consequences

We have to remove the other version.

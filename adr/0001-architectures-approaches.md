Date: 2023-02-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The talk is based on which architectural flow we will use for this project and why.

## Decision

As we have decents knowledge of the ddd approach in our studies and in our jobs, we will use this approach for this project. We will use the hexagonal architecture to separate the business logic from the infrastructure.

## Consequences

It will be more complicated than a simple mvc approach but it will be more maintainable.
